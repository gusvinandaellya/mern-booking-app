# Booking App Frontend (MERN STACK)

This is the frontend for the Booking App, a dynamic and user-friendly application built using the MERN stack. The frontend is developed with React and Vite, leveraging modern libraries and tools to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience. The design is inspired by Airbnb's interface.
